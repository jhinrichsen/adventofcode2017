== Introduction

I don't aim for speed of implementation, meaning being the first to submit.
While Advent of Code emphasizes speed, I prioritize completeness and getting the first answer correct on the first try.
The number of tries is priority number one, so you will find exhaustive test cases.
Although puzzle solutions are user specific, the test cases (`dayNN_test.go`) contain the hardcoded results, so you can safely look at the solutions (`dayNN.go`).

After correctness, I use the problems for performance tuning: minimize runtime and minimize memory allocations.

I know a thing or two about C but this is just too dense to translate to Go.
The PARI based implementation uses no blocks, but comma operators all over the place and for loops in the arguments of a for loop.
I'll take the easy route and use the [https://oeis.org/A141481/b141481.txt] result table.

=== Performance Optimizations

Day 14 requires computing 128 knot hashes (Day 10 Part 2), making it computationally intensive.
Three optimization iterations were benchmarked:

**b0 (baseline)**: Initial implementation
- Switch statement for hex conversion
- Inner loop for bit extraction
- `fmt.Sprintf` for string formatting
- Recursive flood fill

**b1**: Parsing optimizations
- Hex lookup table `[256]byte` instead of switch
- Unrolled 4-bit extraction (no inner loop)
- `strconv.Itoa` instead of `fmt.Sprintf`
- Iterative flood fill with explicit stack

**b2**: Inlined knot hash
- Inlined Day10Part2 into NewDay14
- Reused buffers across 128 iterations (lengths, list, dense)
- Direct byte→bit conversion (no hex string intermediate)
- Eliminated 128 function calls and string allocations

Overall: **-58% memory**, **-99% allocations** at the cost of +3% runtime.
The slight slowdown is likely due to larger function body reducing instruction cache efficiency, but the massive reduction in allocations significantly reduces GC pressure.

== Day 15: Dueling Generators

=== Performance Optimizations

Day 15 implements linear congruential generators (LCG) requiring billions of modulo operations.
Two implementations were benchmarked to compare Go compiler optimizations versus hand-written assembly.

**b0 (baseline)**: Pure Go implementation
- Simple modulo arithmetic: `(a * factor) % 2147483647`
- Bitwise comparison: `a&0xFFFF == b&0xFFFF`
- 40 million iterations (Part 1), 5 million pairs (Part 2)

**b1**: Hand-written AMD64 assembly
- Direct use of MULQ and DIVQ instructions for modulo
- Explicit register allocation (R14=a, R15=b, R8=matches)
- Same algorithm as b0, translated to assembly

==== Benchmark Results

----
              │    b0     │     b1      │
              │  sec/op   │   sec/op    │
Day15Part1-16   109ms       139ms         +27% slower
Day15Part2-16   196ms       231ms         +18% slower

Both: 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op
----

**Surprising result**: The assembly version is significantly slower than Go.

The Go compiler's optimizer produces faster code because:
- Modern Go compiler uses sophisticated optimizations for modulo operations
- The DIV instruction on x86-64 is notoriously slow (not well-pipelined, high latency)
- Go may use strength reduction or other algebraic optimizations
- Assembly version suffers from instruction decode overhead

This demonstrates that hand-written assembly is not always faster on modern architectures with sophisticated compilers.
Both implementations achieve zero allocations.

== Day 16: Permutation Promenade

== Day 17: Spinlock

=== Performance Optimizations

Day 17 implements a circular buffer with 2017 insertions.
The maximum buffer size is known (2018 elements), enabling pre-allocation.

Two approaches were compared:

**Array-backed linked list**: O(1) insertion
- Pre-allocate array of 2018 nodes
- Each node stores value and next index
- Insert by updating pointers only
- Requires ~661,000 pointer chases (328 steps × 2017 insertions)

**Pre-allocated slice**: O(n) insertion with copy()
- Pre-allocate with capacity 2018: `make([]int, 1, 2018)`
- Insert using `append()` + `copy()` to shift elements
- Uses highly optimized `memmove` (vectorized CPU instructions)

==== Benchmark Results

----
                        │  Linked List  │  Slice + copy()  │
                        │    sec/op     │     sec/op       │
Day17Part1-16 (2017)      816μs           68μs              12x faster

Both: 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op
----

**Surprising result**: The O(n) slice approach is 12x faster than O(1) linked list.

Why slice + copy() wins:
- `copy()` uses optimized `memmove` with vectorized SIMD instructions
- Sequential memory access is cache-friendly (spatial locality)
- CPU prefetcher can predict and preload data
- Modern CPUs excel at bulk memory operations

Why linked list loses:
- Pointer chasing causes random memory access (cache misses)
- Each step requires dereferencing: `current = nodes[current].next`
- Poor spatial locality defeats CPU cache hierarchy
- No opportunity for SIMD vectorization

**Lesson**: Algorithmic complexity (Big-O) doesn't predict real-world performance.
Hardware characteristics (cache, SIMD, prefetching) often dominate constant factors.
The "theoretically slower" O(n) algorithm wins due to hardware realities.
